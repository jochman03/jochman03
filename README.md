## Hi there 👋

Embedded-focused developer working primarily with STM32, ESP32, and ESP8266.

I write low-level C and C++, develop firmware directly from datasheets, and design complete hardware–software systems. I also leverage simulations to validate behavior before deploying code on hardware.

Lately, I’ve been focusing on C++ software development, expanding my skills in embedded programming and real-time system design.
